The hydra puck is a strange creature, spawned from the blood 
of an ancient hydra who is said to have grown too large for the 
world. Slain by a nameless hero, its countless heads fell to the 
ground, and out of each severed throat crawled a diminutive 
beast who shared its creatorâ€™s hateful hunger.
